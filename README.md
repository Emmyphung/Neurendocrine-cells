# Neurendocrine-cells
The project aims at tracking the three phase transformation of neuroendocrine cells specific to the human colon, which is illustrated in the figure below. A stem cell transforms into a progenitor cell and finally a mature cell through symmetric and asymmetric cell division. Symmetric cell division, also known as self-renewal, occurs when a stem cell divides symmetrically into two identical stem cells. Asymmetric cell division characterizes the maturation process when a stem cell divides into a stem cell and a progenitor cell, or a progenitor cell divides into a progenitor cell and a mature cell. In each phase, cells also experience apoptosis. meaning cell death. With an aim to capture this phenomenon, I want to build a model that track the number of cells in each phase, stem cells, progenitor cells and mature cells.
